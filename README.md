# CYB333-Final
Final for class
This project implements a lightweight, Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to demonstrate fundamental security automation concepts. The IDS analyzes authentication log files to detect potentially malicious behavior, such as repeated failed login attempts that may indicate a brute-force attack. By automating log analysis, the system reduces manual review efforts and provides timely alerts when suspicious activity is identified.

The project was developed as part of a security automation course and focuses on clarity, simplicity, and correctness rather than advanced detection techniques. It serves as a foundational example of how Python scripting can be used to support proactive security monitoring.
